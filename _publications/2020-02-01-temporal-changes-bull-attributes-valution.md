**Abstract.**  Past attempts to price bull attributes have relied on static marginal valuations due to cross-sectional
 data limitations. This analysis investigates whether bull buyers' marginal valuations of Angus bull
 attributes have changed over time using 17 years of bull auction data from Indiana. Results indicate
 statistically significant time effects on some traits (e.g., ribeye area, percentage intermuscular
 fat, ribeye-area expected progeny difference (EPD), and maternal-milk EPD). Not all of these
 effects align with prior expectations. Nonetheless, results have important implications for the beef
 industry in terms of signaling quality ques and incorporating proven information in the form of
 EPDs.
