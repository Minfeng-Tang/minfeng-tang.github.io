**Abstract.** Beef is a good source of several vitamins and minerals but data onthenetcontribution to the
 humandiet is lacking. The objective was to quantify the net nutrient contribution of the beef supply
 chain to provide vitamins and minerals to the human diet. Beef cattle production parameters for the
 beef supply chain were as described by Baber et al., 2018 with the red and organ meat yield from
 each production segment estimated using literature values of serially-harvested beef cattle. Nutrient
 concentration of feeds was acquired from feed composition tables in nutrient requirement texts, and
 the nutrient concentration of beef and organ meats was based on 2018 USDA Food and Nutrient
 Database for Dietary Studies. The nutrient absorption coefficients of feeds, red meat, and organs were
 acquired from the literature. The human-edible conversion ratio was >1.0 for phosphorus when only
 red meat yield was considered indicating that the beef supply chain produced more human-edible
 phosphorus than it consumed. When organ meats were included, riboflavin, niacin, choline, and
 phosphorus had conversion ratios >1.0. After adjusting for the absorption of nutrients, the beef
 supply chain was a net contributor of niacin and phosphorus in the human diet when accounting
 for red meat yield only, but when including organ meats, iron, riboflavin, and choline also had
 conversion ratios >1.0. The maximum proportion of corn in the corn grain plus distillers' grains
 component of the feedlot diets for the absorbable conversion ratio to be 1 ranged from 8.34 to
 100.00% when only red meat yield was considered and from 32.02 to 100.00% when red and organ
 meats were considered. In conclusion, the current beef production system in the Southern Great
 Plains produces more human-absorbable iron, phosphorus, riboflavin, niacin, and choline to the
 humandiet than is consumed in the beef supply chain
