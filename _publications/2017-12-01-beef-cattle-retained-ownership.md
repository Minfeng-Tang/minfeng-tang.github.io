**Abstract.** The effect of animal characteristics and placement decisions on retained
ownership profitability of Tennessee cattle from 2005 to 2015 was determined
using a mixed model regression. Ex post simulation analysis examined retained
ownership profitability by placement season under different animal characteristic
and corn price scenarios. Regression results indicate that placement weight,
placement season, days on feed, animal health, and animal sex affect retained
ownership profitability. Simulation results indicate that winter placement of cattle
in feedlots had the highest expected retained ownership profits. Results provide
risk-averse producers information regarding the profitability of retained
ownership.
