**Abstract.** Recently, the government of Canada has encouraged the use of rotational grazing (RG) within its Sustainable Agriculture Strategy to improve soil health and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the livestock sector. However, the effectiveness of RG in improving soil health and preventing climate change remains unclear. The objective was to summarize the evidence on the impact of RG on plant productivity, GHG emissions, soil health, and plant richness and diversity in cow-calf operations in Canada and similar climate regions. This scoping review followed PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. Studies could be randomized controlled trials, randomized block design, controlled trials, observational, or simulation studies. Retrieved studies were screened in two stages by two independent reviewers. After screening, 15 studies were considered relevant and included in the review, and 46 outcomes were extracted. Of these, 46.5% showed a positive impact of RG, while 53.5% reported RG having neutral or no impact. There was a consistent body of evidence proving that RG benefits plant productivity. However, the evidence showing benefits on soil health and GHG emissions varied depending on the outcomes assessed. There was minimal evidence of impact on plant diversity. Rotational grazing has benefited soil surface properties, water dynamics, and nutrient availability.
