I'm Minfeng Tang, an agricultural and applied economist with a strong focus on data-driven research and policy analysis. My work integrates economic modeling, statistical analysis, and real-world applications to support sustainable food systems, rural development, and environmental stewardship.

With training in economics, data science, and interdisciplinary collaboration, I've worked across academia and policy settings - including projects on livestock systems, climate-smart agriculture, and program evaluation. I'm passionate about using data and economics to inform decisions that matter for communities, ecosystems, and the future of food.

This site is a space to share my research, tools, blog posts, and learning journey. Whether you're a fellow researcher, policymaker, or just curious - welcome.

Feel free to explore my work, get in touch, or connect via GitHub or LinkedIn.
