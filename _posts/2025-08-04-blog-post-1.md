  A few days ago, I attended a webinar hosted by the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI) titled 
  "From Delay to Direction: Shaping Canada's Next Ag Policy Framework." During the session, the panelists 
  raised a thought-provoking question: <em>Competitiveness vs. Sustainability - Which should come first for 
  Canadian agriculture?</em>
  <br><br>
  As an applied researcher specializing in agricultural economics and policy in both the U.S. and Canada, 
  I found this question particularly compelling. It warrants deeper reflection - especially in the context 
  of Canada's evolving agri-food policy landscape. In this post, I explore the issue further through a 
  preliminary analysis of economic and environmental data.
