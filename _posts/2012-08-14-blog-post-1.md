A few days ago, I attended a webinar hosted by the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI) titled *"From Delay to Direction: Shaping Canada's Next Ag Policy Framework."* During the session, the panelists raised a thought-provoking question:

> **Competitiveness vs. Sustainability - Which should come first for Canadian agriculture?**

As an applied researcher specializing in agricultural economics and policy in both the U.S. and Canada, I found this question particularly compelling. It warrants deeper reflection-especially in the context of Canada's evolving agri-food policy landscape. In this post, I explore the question further through a preliminary analysis of economic and environmental data.
